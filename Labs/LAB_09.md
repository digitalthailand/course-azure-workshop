# Module 9: Implementing Azure Active Directory
# Lab: Implementing Azure AD
  
### Scenario
  
 The IT department at A. Datum Corporation currently uses AD DS, and a range of Active Directory-aware applications. While preparing for synchronizing its AD DS to Azure AD, A. Datum wants you to test some of the features of Azure AD. The company wants you to control access to third-party SaaS apps by using Azure AD users and groups. A. Datum also wants you to configure SSO to these apps and protect them by using Multi-Factor Authentication.

In addition to these tasks, A. Datum wants you to evaluate some of the advanced features Azure AD Premium offers. It also wants you join a Windows 10-based computer to an Azure AD tenant to prepare for implementing this configuration on all the Windows 10-based computers in the Research department.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Administer Azure AD. 

- Configure SSO for Azure AD gallery applications.

- Configure multi-factor authentication for administrators.

- Use the advanced features offered by Azure AD Premium.

- Configure SSO from a Windows 10-based computer that is joined to Azure AD.


### Lab Setup

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created some pilot users and groups in Azure AD by using the Azure portal and Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell. You will also enable the Azure AD Premium functionality.


## Exercise 2: Configuring SSO
  
### Scenario
  
 Because A. Datum is planning to deploy cloud-based applications, and requires users to use SSO for these applications, you now want to install and configure a test application, and then validate the SSO experience. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Add directory applications and configure SSO

2. Test SSO



#### Task 1: Add directory applications and configure SSO
  
1. In the **Adatum** directory, add the **Microsoft Account (Windows Live)** application from the gallery:

2. Configure single sign-on for the application with the **Pasword-based Sign-on** setting.

3. Assign the application to **Mario Ledford**.

4. Select the option that allows you to enter the Microsoft account credentials on behalf of the user.

5. In the **Email Address** box, type the name of your Microsoft account you are using for this lab. In the **Password** box, type the corresponding password, and then click the check mark.

6. In the **Adatum** directory, add the **Skype** application from the gallery:

7. Configure single sign-on for the application with the **Pasword-based Sign-on** setting.

8. Assign the application to **Mario Ledford**


#### Task 2: Test SSO
  
1. Open an Internet Explorer window and browse to https://myapps.microsoft.com. When prompted, sign in by using specify the full user name (including the @_domain name_.onmicrosoft.com suffix) of the Mario Ledford's account and the corresponding password **Pa55w.ord**. 

2. On the applications page, click the ellipsis next to **Skype**. Note the option to update the credentials. 

3. On the applications page, click the ellipsis next to **Microsoft Account**. Note that there is no option to update the credentials.

4. Click **Skype** and, when prompted, install the Access Panel Extension with the default settings and enable the extension once the installation completes.

5. Restart Internet Explorer and browse to https://myapps.microsoft.com. When prompted, sign in as Mario Ledford.

6. From the Application Access Panel, start **Skype**. Note that you are now prompted for credentials, because you did not enter any credentials on behalf of the user when configuring SSO. 

7. Click **Cancel** in the **Skype** dialog box.

8. Sign out from the Application Access Panel and close Internet Explorer.


> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have installed and configured a test application and validated the SSO experience.


## Exercise 3: Configuring Multi-Factor Authentication
  
### Scenario
  
 Because A. Datum requires applications to use Multi-Factor Authentication, you now want to configure and test Multi-Factor Authentication for Global Administrators.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure Multi-Factor Authentication

2. Test Multi-Factor Authentication



#### Task 1: Configure Multi-Factor Authentication
  
1. Start Internet Exploer and sign in to the Azure portal by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your subscription.

2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for the Adatum Azure AD user account of **Karen Gruber**.

3. Close Internet Explorer.


#### Task 2: Test Multi-Factor Authentication
  
1. Open Internet explorer, browse to **https://myapps.microsoft.com**, and sign in as Karen Gruber. You will be presented with the message stating _Your admin has required that you set up this account for additional security verification_.

2. Click **Set it up now**.

3. On the **Additional security verification** page, in the first drop-down list, select **Authentication phone**. Enter your phone number and select the option **Call me**.

4. Close Internet Explorer

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured Multi-Factor Authentication for a Global Admin account.


## Exercise 4: Configuring SSO from a Windows 10-based computer that is joined to Azure AD
  
### Scenario
  
 A. Datum has an increasing demand to provide its remote and mobile users, who are using Windows 10-based devices, with secure access to the cloud resources. The company wants to join Windows 10 devices to Azure AD and simplify access to cloud resources by enabling SSO. Before they can implement this, you want to test this functionality by joining a WindowsÂ 10-based computer to Azure AD. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Join a Windows 10-based computer to Azure AD

2. Authenticate to Azure from a Windows 10 Azure-joined computer

3. Reset the environment



#### Task 1: Join a Windows 10-based computer to Azure AD
  
1. Open Internet Explore and sign in to the Azure portal by using your Azure subscription.

2. Verify that the **Adatum** directory allows all users to join their devices to Azure AD.

3. On MIA-CL1, click **Settings**, click **Accounts**, and then join MIA-CL1 into Azure AD by using the Adatum Azure AD credentials of Karen Gruber.

4. Verify that **MIA-CL1** is shown on the **DEVICES** tab of the **Karen Gruber** user account.

5. Restart **MIA-CL1**.


#### Task 2: Authenticate to Azure from a Windows 10 Azure-joined computer
  
1. Sign in to MIA-CL1 by using the Karen Gruber's Adatum Azure AD account and **Pa55w.rd** as its password.

2. Accept the incoming call and press # key on your phone to complete verification.

3. Set up a PIN but do not wait until its fully provisioned.

4. Start Internet Explorer, and then go to **https://portal.azure.com**.

5. Verify that you are automatically signed in as Karen Gruber by using SSO.

6. Sign out from MIA-CL1


#### Task 3: Reset the environment
  
1. Sign in to MIA-CL1 by using the **Student** account and the **Pa55w.rd** password.

2. On the taskbar, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then click **Run as administrator**. 

3. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**.

4. In the PowerShell ISE, from the console pane, run the following command:

  ```
  Reset-Azure
  ```

5. When prompted (twice), sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator of your subscription.

6. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want the deprovisioning script to target.

7. When prompted for confirmation, type **y.**

> **Note:** This script removes Azure services in your subscription. Therefore, we recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course and not your own Azure account.
> The script resets your Azure environment so that it is ready for the next lab. 
> The script removes all storage accounts, virtual machines, virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups containing these resources.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have joined the MIA-CL1 computer to Azure AD and tested the SSO access to the resources in the cloud.
